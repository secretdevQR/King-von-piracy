Hey there fellas!
Main.py is the python script

This script is made for a video that u cant close unless u aleardy have task manager open.

U need a MP3 file which is for a song
And u also need a MP4 file
From this link u can convert a youtube link into a MP3 or MP4 file download.
(u can change the script to a link instead of converting , downloading , choosing the path)

Its not really that good maybe u guys make some changes in it and make all USB-HID devices unusable 
thats really up to u guys.

    video_path = ""  
    audio_path = ""
